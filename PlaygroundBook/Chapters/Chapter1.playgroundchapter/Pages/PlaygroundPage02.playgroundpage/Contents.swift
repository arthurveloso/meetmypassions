 # Meet My Passions
 
 First passion: **Tech!** 📱📱📱📱📱
 
 Going to **WWDC** was always one of my biggest dreams in life. The dream started as the same time that my love for technology (and Apple) was born.
 
 I won my first Apple device back in 2008, it was a second generation iPod touch, I was impressed with everything that involved this device, it was really magical and remarkable.
   
 
 After that I started to look for more topics related to technology, I won my second Apple device, an iPod touch 4th generation, to be able to upgrade to iOS 5 that did not support my old device
   
 
 In 2012 I joined Computer Engineering graduation course and, along with a friend who shared the same passions for technology as myself, started a podcast that spoke primarily to Apple.
 
 
 We did some episodes and made it available on the internet.
 
 
 In this playground I would like you to position a **3D radio** specially modeled for this playground, using **Augmented Reality**, I wanted to bring the idea of ​​something old-school.
 
 
 Look for a plane (a gray plane will appear) and position the radio on top. Once you position you will be able to listen to a small part of a fictional episode from my podcast, also made especially for this Playground 😁
 
 
 Try to go closer or move away from the radio, you will see that the volume changes according to the proximity, 3D audio is very nice 🤓
