 # More than football
 
 Time for my 2nd passion
   
 Football ... oh, football, that passion started a little bit before the first, when I was 4 years old and I remember my father taking me on the shoulder for a game, against the main rival of my team.
   
 Everyone who knows me knows of my love for my club, Sport Club of Recife ⚫️🔴 and how each game makes me have chills.
   
 When I was 5 years old, I moved from town to town, and I started to live more than 2,800 km away from my club and my hometown.
   
 The passion for the club and the football could not die, since then we went to watch by the TV, joining people in the new city that also supported the same club. We always try to go back to the hometown and see a game at least once a year.
   
 To portray a little of my passion for football, I used a 3D model also made exclusively for this playground. The model is a miniature of the Amazon Arena, stadium located at my current city, Manaus, built especially for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.
   
 Like the first passion, look for a plane, the playground will position a gray plane as soon as you find something that can interact. Just click on the plan to position the stadium.
   
 Once positioned the war cry of my team's fans will begin to play, try to go closer to the stadium to have an even greater immersion, or step away if you do not want to hear 😄
