 # Meet My Passions
 
 Hello! Welcome to my Playground.
 
 My name is Arthur and I'm a Computer Science student with many passions to share.
 
 Going to WWDC was always one of my biggest dreams in life. The dream started as the same time that my love for technology (and Apple) was born.
 
 Back in 2008 I won as present from my parentes my first Apple product, a 2nd generation iPod touch. It was magical to me, I was **really** impressed by all the possibilities that were opened with that device. I love how the accelerometer work, played a lot of games with it and fell in love.
