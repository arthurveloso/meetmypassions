 # Introduction
 
 Hello! Welcome to my Playground.
 
 My name is Arthur and I'm a Computer Science student with many **passions** to share.
 
I spent some time thinking about what should I do in this playground, wanted to play with things that I work on a day to day basis, but probably would not reflect the message I would like to pass.
 
Finally, I decided to work with my passions, I have many, but for this playground I chose two: **technology** (more specifically Apple) 🤖 and **football** ⚽️
   

 For more immersion, I decided to use Augmented Reality and the features that ARKit provides us with quite easily.
   
 - Experiment:
 I recommend using this playground in landscape mode 😁
   

 Now let's go to the next page, just click the right arrow at the top, next to the title, to know my first passion.
 
 Or click [here](@next) if you prefer.
